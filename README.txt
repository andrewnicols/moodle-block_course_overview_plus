Installation
------------

1. Place the course_overview_plus folder in the blocks folder and check permissions to make sure your webserver can read the files.

To replace the standard course_overview block
---------------------------------------------

1. Select 'customise this page' in My Moodle and delete the Course Overview block.
2. Add the Course Overview Plus block.
3. This is unlikely to appear in the correct place, move the block to the second slot down in the main column.

To add the example course filters
---------------------------------

1. Select 'customise this page' in My Moodle.
2. Select the configuration button at the top of the Course Overview Plus block.
3. Tick the checkboxes to display each course filter at the top of the block, you can display more than one at once.

Problems?
--------

You can email me at der_andrew_james@yahoo.co.uk

As well as the example course filters included in the block, I am also able to extend the block to allow filtering of the course list by other criteria (http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=184870&parent=805019) 
or provide help for developers who wish to do this.
